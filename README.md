<p id="description">### **Course Management CRM System**

This CRM system is designed specifically to streamline and manage educational courses for institutions or training centers. It offers a robust and efficient solution to handle course registration, track student enrollment, and monitor staff performance while improving administrative workflows.

#### **Key Features:**

1. **Admin and Employee Login:**
   The CRM system supports two types of users: Admins and Employees. Admins can log in to manage the entire system, while employees (such as teachers or staff) have their own dedicated interface to handle specific tasks.

2. **Course Management:**
   Administrators can create, update, and manage courses within the system, including course details, schedules, and student assignments. This feature allows for easy tracking and updating of available courses to ensure students have access to the latest offerings.

3. **Student Enrollment:**
   The system enables seamless student registration for courses. Admins or employees can register students, assign them to specific courses, and view their course history and performance.

4. **Sales and Performance Tracking:**
   The system provides powerful sales tracking features, allowing admins to monitor monthly sales data in real-time. A visual sales chart gives a clear overview of financial performance, while a leaderboard feature ranks employees based on their sales contributions.

5. **Leaderboard & Performance Analytics:**
   To promote transparency and motivation, a leaderboard is available that ranks employees based on their performance metrics, such as sales. The system offers detailed insights into employee productivity and contributions, allowing managers to reward top performers.

6. **User-Friendly Interface:**
   With a clean and intuitive interface, the CRM is easy to navigate for both admins and employees. The use of a modal-based login system ensures a streamlined entry experience, and the system includes a sleek and modern design optimized for both desktop and mobile views.

7. **Role-Based Access:**
   Admins have full access to manage courses, employees, and the financial performance of the company. Employees, on the other hand, are granted role-based access, allowing them to manage tasks related to course management and student support without full administrative privileges.

8. **Real-Time Reporting and Alerts:**
   The CRM system includes real-time data reporting for admins to monitor performance metrics instantly. It provides alerts and notifications for critical tasks or deadlines, ensuring nothing is overlooked.

#### **Technologies Used:**

- **Frontend:** The system‚Äôs user interface is built using modern web technologies like React, allowing for a dynamic and responsive design. It integrates pagination and smooth transitions for an optimal user experience.
  
- **Backend:** A Java-based backend powers the CRM, handling user authentication, course management, and database interactions efficiently. APIs are utilized to fetch sales data and employee performance for real-time insights.

- **Data Visualization:** Sales performance is visualized using interactive charts, giving admins a clear, graphical representation of the company‚Äôs monthly and annual financial performance.

### **Use Case:**

This CRM system is ideal for educational institutions, training centers, or any organization that offers courses to students and needs to manage registrations, track staff performance, and monitor financial metrics. It provides the necessary tools to centralize operations, improve organizational efficiency, and offer an enhanced experience for both staff and students.
